{"note_text":"Meeting notes – 14 Feb 2026\n\nCustomer: Martin Kovács, DOB 1978, Hungarian national currently resident in Malta (claims tax residency in Malta since 2021). Married, two children. Longstanding client since 2019 but this is the first detailed source of wealth review at this level.\n\nBackground \/ occupation:\nCustomer describes himself as a “private investor and consultant.” Previously employed as a senior IT project manager for a German automotive supplier until 2016. Since then, he states he has been self‑employed, providing ad hoc technology consulting while primarily managing his own investments. No clear ongoing consulting contracts presented; income described as “irregular and not material compared to investments.”\n\nStated source of wealth (total EUR 2,016,807):\n1) Public equities and ETFs: approx. EUR 1,180,000\nCustomer states this was built over time through active trading and long-term holdings in US and EU-listed stocks and ETFs. He referenced accounts with two brokers: one EU-based (Degiro) and one US-based (Interactive Brokers, account originally opened while he was resident in Germany). Provided partial broker statements for 2022–2024 showing current portfolio value around EUR 950,000. Remainder explained as gains realized in 2020–2021 and subsequently reinvested, but no statements for those earlier periods were provided. There is a discrepancy between the EUR 1.18m claimed and the EUR 950k evidenced.\n\n2) Bond investments and fixed income products: approx. EUR 436,000\nCustomer claims holdings in EU government bonds and a Luxembourg-domiciled bond fund. Provided one annual statement from a Maltese investment platform showing EUR 312,000 as of Dec 2024. He verbally mentioned an additional EUR 120k in “older bonds” purchased while living in Germany, but no documentation available yet. Dates of purchase unclear; he alternated between “around 2017” and “before I left Germany in 2016.”\n\n3) Investment funds \/ alternative funds: approx. EUR 400,807\nCustomer stated he invested in two offshore funds:\n- A Cayman Islands-domiciled hedge fund (approx. EUR 250,000 initial investment, now allegedly worth EUR 310,000).\n- An Irish-domiciled private equity fund with a current value of approx. EUR 90,807.\nOnly provided a capital call notice for the Irish fund and an email update (not an official statement) from the Cayman fund manager dated mid‑2023. No audited statements or recent NAV confirmations provided. Customer was vague on redemption terms and could not clearly explain fund strategy beyond “macro and special situations.”\n\nTotal amount:\nCustomer insists total net investment wealth equals EUR 2,016,807 as of January 2026. Based on documents seen, verifiable amount is closer to EUR 1.35–1.45m. Customer attributes difference to “market movements and older accounts I haven’t consolidated yet.”\n\nDocuments provided:\n- Partial broker statements (2022–2024) from EU broker\n- One annual investment platform statement (Dec 2024)\n- Capital call notice from Irish PE fund\n- Email update from offshore hedge fund manager\n\nDocuments requested (outstanding):\n- Full historical broker statements showing build-up of wealth (pre‑2020)\n- Proof of initial capital (salary slips, savings) from employment period in Germany\n- Official, recent NAV statements for offshore funds\n- Tax residency confirmation from Malta and recent tax returns (last 2 years)\n\nObservations and assessment:\nCustomer is articulate but often vague when discussing timelines and original sources of capital. Explanations shifted slightly when questioned on dates and amounts, particularly regarding bonds and offshore fund investments. He appears financially literate but reluctant to provide older documentation, stating it is “time-consuming” to retrieve. Multiple jurisdictions involved (Germany, Malta, US brokers, Cayman Islands, Ireland), which increases complexity.\n\nConcerns \/ red flags:\n- Inconsistencies between stated total wealth and documented amounts.\n- Heavy reliance on offshore and non-transparent fund structures with limited documentation.\n- Unclear origin of initial investment capital prior to 2017.\n- Evasive responses when asked about tax treatment of offshore investments.\n\nOverall, source of wealth is plausible given long-term investing activity and prior professional background, but currently insufficiently documented. Enhanced due diligence recommended. Account activity should remain limited until outstanding documents are received and reviewed.","structured_output":"{\"customer_name\": \"Martin Kov\\u00e1cs\", \"occupation\": \"Private investor and consultant (formerly senior IT project manager; currently self-employed with irregular consulting income)\", \"wealth_sources\": [{\"source_type\": \"investment\", \"amount\": 1180000, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Public equities and ETFs built through active trading and long-term holdings in US and EU-listed stocks and ETFs via EU and US brokers; documentation partially provided with discrepancies between claimed and evidenced values.\"}, {\"source_type\": \"investment\", \"amount\": 436000, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Bond investments including EU government bonds and a Luxembourg-domiciled bond fund; partial documentation provided with unclear purchase dates and missing evidence for older bonds.\"}, {\"source_type\": \"investment\", \"amount\": 400807, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Investments in offshore and alternative funds, including a Cayman Islands hedge fund and an Irish-domiciled private equity fund; limited and non-official documentation provided.\"}], \"total_amount\": 2016807, \"risk_level\": \"high\", \"documents_provided\": [\"Partial broker statements (2022\\u20132024) from EU-based broker\", \"One annual investment platform statement (Dec 2024)\", \"Capital call notice from Irish private equity fund\", \"Email update from Cayman Islands hedge fund manager\", \"Full historical broker statements showing build-up of wealth (requested)\", \"Proof of initial capital from employment period in Germany (requested)\", \"Official, recent NAV statements for offshore funds (requested)\", \"Tax residency confirmation from Malta and recent tax returns (requested)\"], \"flags\": [\"Discrepancy between stated total wealth and documented amounts\", \"Reliance on offshore and non-transparent fund structures with limited documentation\", \"Unclear origin of initial investment capital prior to 2017\", \"Inconsistent explanations regarding dates and amounts of bond and fund investments\", \"Evasive responses regarding tax treatment of offshore investments\", \"Multiple jurisdictions involved increasing complexity\"]}","scenario_type":"investment","difficulty":"hard"}
{"note_text":"Meeting notes – Client: Mr. Daniel R. Kaufmann, DOB 14.08.1974, Swiss national currently resident in Dubai (UAE) since 2018. Introduced by existing client relationship. Meeting held in Zurich office with client present in person.\n\nBackground: Mr. Kaufmann presents himself as a serial entrepreneur and private investor. He indicated that his net worth is the result of several business ventures over the past 20+ years, primarily in commodities trading, private equity investments, and real estate. He also mentioned family wealth but was vague on the extent and timing of any inheritance.\n\nOccupation \/ business activities: Currently self-described as “private investor and advisor.” Previously founder and majority shareholder of Kaufmann Trading AG (Switzerland), allegedly active in metals and agricultural commodities brokerage between 2006 and 2016. He stated the company was sold, but could not clearly confirm whether it was a full sale or partial exit. He also claims to hold minority stakes in two offshore investment vehicles registered in the BVI and Cayman Islands, managed by third-party advisors.\n\nSource of wealth (total stated wealth: CHF 41,570,403):\n\n1) Sale of Kaufmann Trading AG: Client stated proceeds of approx. CHF 18–20 million from the sale in 2016. In earlier onboarding documents, he referenced CHF 15 million. No final, consistent figure provided. He verbally confirmed that part of the proceeds were paid in instalments over several years. No share purchase agreement provided to date; client said documents are “with former lawyers” and will be shared later.\n\n2) Real estate investments: Client claims approx. CHF 12,300,000 derived from property sales and rental income. Properties mentioned include:\n- Residential property in Zug sold in 2019 (approx. CHF 6.8m per client)\n- Two apartments in Berlin still held, with accumulated rental income of approx. CHF 1.1m since 2014\n- Commercial property in Spain sold in 2022 for “around EUR 4–5m”\nFigures provided verbally do not fully reconcile, and no sale contracts, land registry extracts, or rental statements were provided at this stage.\n\n3) Investment funds \/ offshore structures: Approx. CHF 7,500,000 held via BVI and Cayman funds. Client described these as “family investment structures” but confirmed he is the ultimate beneficial owner. He was unable to clearly explain the underlying assets, stating only that they are “a mix of private equity and structured products.” NAV statements were not available; he promised to request them from the fund administrator.\n\n4) Inheritance \/ family wealth: Client briefly mentioned receiving approx. CHF 3–4 million from his father’s estate following his death in 2013 (father was a German national, reportedly involved in manufacturing). No probate documents, will, or inheritance tax records were provided. Client was uncertain whether the funds were received in one or several tranches.\n\nDocuments provided:\n- Copy of Swiss passport\n- Recent utility bill (UAE address)\n- CV \/ personal profile\nNo financial documents substantiating source of wealth were provided during the meeting.\n\nDocuments requested:\n- Sale agreement and payment schedule for Kaufmann Trading AG\n- Audited financials or exit confirmation for the company\n- Property sale contracts and land registry excerpts (Zug, Spain)\n- Rental income statements for Berlin properties\n- NAV statements and structure charts for BVI and Cayman funds\n- Inheritance documentation (probate or bank statements evidencing receipt)\n- Explanation of offshore structures and role of intermediaries\n\nObservations and assessment: Client was confident but often imprecise when discussing figures and timelines. Several amounts differ from earlier onboarding information, and explanations were sometimes vague, particularly regarding offshore investments and inheritance. He appeared reluctant to commit to specific dates and repeatedly referred to third parties (lawyers, advisors) as holding the documentation. While overall wealth level appears plausible given business background, current information is insufficiently substantiated.\n\nConcerns \/ red flags: \n- Significant inconsistencies in stated proceeds from company sale.\n- Use of multiple offshore jurisdictions (BVI, Cayman) with limited transparency on underlying assets.\n- Incomplete documentation for major components of wealth.\n- Vague explanation of inheritance and lack of supporting records.\n- Residence in UAE combined with complex cross-border structures increases AML risk.\n\nOverall, source","structured_output":"{\"customer_name\": \"Mr. Daniel R.
