{"note_text":"Met with customer Marco Rossi today to discuss source of wealth in relation to recent funds credited to his account.\n\nMr. Rossi is an Italian national, resident in Milan, and has been a long-standing customer of the bank. He is a former business owner and entrepreneur. Until recently, he was the sole shareholder and managing director of Rossi Digital Solutions S.r.l., an IT services company providing software development and systems integration services to small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nMr. Rossi explained that the source of the funds is the sale of his company. In September 2025, he sold 100% of his shares in Rossi Digital Solutions S.r.l. to a third-party buyer, TechNova Group S.p.A. The total net proceeds paid to Mr. Rossi amounted to EUR 221,981, which represents the agreed sale price after settlement of outstanding liabilities and transaction costs. The funds were transferred directly from the buyer’s corporate account to Mr. Rossi’s personal account with our bank.\n\nTo support this, Mr. Rossi provided full documentation, including the signed share purchase agreement, confirmation of share transfer from the Italian Companies Register, the completion statement showing the net proceeds of EUR 221,981, and the incoming payment advice from the buyer’s bank. Documents reviewed appear complete, consistent, and in line with the explanation provided.\n\nDuring the meeting, Mr. Rossi was open, cooperative, and able to clearly explain the background of the business and the sale process. The transaction aligns with his known profile as a business owner, and the amount is reasonable given the size and profitability of the company as described.\n\nNo concerns or red flags identified. Source of wealth is clear, legitimate, and adequately evidenced. No further documentation required at this stage.","structured_output":"{\"customer_name\": \"Marco Rossi\", \"occupation\": \"Former business owner and entrepreneur (IT services company owner and managing director)\", \"wealth_sources\": [{\"source_type\": \"business_sale\", \"amount\": 221981, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Net proceeds from the sale of 100% shareholding in Rossi Digital Solutions S.r.l. to TechNova Group S.p.A. in September 2025\"}], \"total_amount\": 221981, \"risk_level\": \"low\", \"documents_provided\": [\"Signed share purchase agreement\", \"Confirmation of share transfer from the Italian Companies Register\", \"Completion statement showing net proceeds\", \"Incoming payment advice from the buyer\\u2019s bank\"], \"flags\": []}","scenario_type":"business_sale","difficulty":"easy"}
{"note_text":"Meeting held with customer: Martin Kovač, Czech national, resident in Germany since 2016. Married, two dependents. Long-standing client since 2021. Purpose of meeting was to review source of wealth in relation to incoming funds totalling approx. EUR 390,870 credited over the past 14 months.\n\nBackground and occupation: Mr Kovač is an employed professional, currently Senior IT Systems Architect with a multinational logistics software firm headquartered in Munich. Employed there since 2018. Annual gross salary stated as approx. EUR 118,000 plus variable bonus. He also mentioned occasional side activities which are not part of his employment contract.\n\nStated sources of wealth:\n1) Employment income and bonuses: Mr Kovač states that approx. EUR 215,000 of the total amount relates to net salary savings and annual bonuses accumulated between 2020–2024. He provided recent German payslips (2023–2024) and an employment confirmation letter, but did not provide payslips or tax assessments for 2020–2021, citing that “they are archived with my old tax advisor.” Noted that bonus amounts described verbally (EUR 30–40k per year) do not fully align with net inflows seen on the account, which appear more irregular.\n\n2) Share-based compensation \/ investments: Approx. EUR 92,000 stated to come from the sale of RSUs and employer share options. Shares were apparently held via a US-based brokerage platform. Customer provided screenshots of brokerage balances and two trade confirmations from 2022, but no full transaction history or official tax statement. Dates of liquidation were described as “mostly in late 2022 and early 2023,” however some corresponding credits to our account only appear in mid-2024.\n\n3) Freelance consulting income: Mr Kovač mentioned additional freelance IT consulting for two non-EU clients (one in Switzerland, one in Singapore), generating approx. EUR 48,500 net over the last three years. He described this as “ad hoc and no longer active.” No contracts or invoices were provided during the meeting. He stated income was paid to a fintech account (Revolut) and later transferred here. He was vague on exact timing and whether this activity was formally registered in Germany for tax purposes.\n\n4) Crypto-related gains: Customer stated approx. EUR 35,000 came from cryptocurrency investments (mainly ETH and BTC), initially purchased in 2019–2020. Funds were allegedly realised in 2023 via a Lithuanian exchange and then transferred through an Estonian IBAN account before reaching us. He provided screenshots of wallet balances but no clear buy\/sell history or evidence of original source of funds. He appeared uncomfortable when asked about tax reporting of these gains.\n\nDocuments provided:\n- German employment confirmation letter\n- Recent payslips (2023–2024 only)\n- Partial brokerage screenshots and two trade confirmations\n- Informal screenshots of crypto wallets\n\nDocuments requested but not yet provided:\n- Full tax assessments (2020–2024)\n- Complete brokerage statements showing acquisition and sale of shares\n- Evidence of freelance consulting contracts\/invoices and proof of tax declaration\n- Detailed crypto transaction history and exchange statements\n\nObservations and assessment:\nMr Kovač is articulate and generally cooperative, but explanations were often high-level and at times evasive when discussing side income and crypto activities. There are inconsistencies between the timing of asset sales described and the actual credits observed on the account. Use of multiple jurisdictions (US brokerage, Swiss and Singapore clients, Lithuanian exchange, Estonian IBAN) increases complexity and reduces transparency. Total stated sources broadly add up to the EUR 390,870, but only part of the amount is currently well supported by documentation.\n\nConcerns \/ red flags:\n- Incomplete documentation, especially for older salary savings, freelance income and crypto gains\n- Potential undeclared or under-declared freelance and crypto income from a tax perspective\n- Inconsistent dates between claimed asset disposals and incoming funds\n- Use of multiple offshore \/ non-German platforms without clear rationale\n\nOverall, while the customer’s profile as a senior employed professional is plausible, the source of wealth cannot be considered fully substantiated at this stage. Follow-up required once outstanding documents are provided. Pending satisfactory clarification, heightened monitoring recommended.","structured_output":"{\"customer_name\": \"Martin Kova\\u010d\", \"occupation\": \"Senior IT Systems Architect at a multinational logistics software firm\", \"wealth_sources\": [{\"source_type\": \"employment\", \"amount\": 215000, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Net salary savings and annual bonuses accumulated from employment between 2020 and 2024\"}, {\"source_type\": \"investment\", \"amount\": 92000, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Proceeds from sale of RSUs and employer share options held via a US-based brokerage platform\"}, {\"source_type\": \"business_income\", \"amount\": 48500, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Net income from ad hoc freelance IT consulting for non-EU clients over the last three years\"}, {\"source_type\": \"crypto\", \"amount\": 35000, \"currency\": \"EUR\", \"description\": \"Gains from cryptocurrency investments (BTC and ETH) purchased in 2019\\u20132020 and realised in 2023\"}], \"total_amount\": 390870, \"risk_level\": \"high\", \"documents_provided\": [\"German employment confirmation letter\", \"Payslips for 2023\\u20132024\", \"Partial brokerage screenshots\", \"Two trade confirmations from 2022\", \"Screenshots of crypto wallets\", \"Requested: Full tax assessments (2020\\u20132024)\", \"Requested: Complete brokerage statements\", \"Requested: Freelance consulting contracts\/invoices and tax evidence\", \"Requested: Detailed crypto transaction history and exchange statements\"], \"flags\": [\"Incomplete documentation for salary savings, freelance income and crypto gains\", \"Inconsistencies between claimed asset sale dates and observed account credits\", \"Potential undeclared or under-declared freelance and crypto income for tax purposes\", \"Use of multiple jurisdictions and offshore platforms reducing transparency\"]}","scenario_type":"employment","difficulty":"hard"}
{"note_text":"Met with customer Michael Turner today to discuss recent inflow of funds and overall source of wealth. Michael is a 46-year-old US citizen, long-term client, currently residing in Austin, TX. Background is mainly in real estate investment and small business ownership. He comes across as knowledgeable but not overly formal, and was open in discussing his finances, though a few details were a bit high level.\n\nMichael’s primary source of wealth is the recent sale of an investment property located in Phoenix, AZ. According to him, the property was purchased in 2016 for approx. USD 420,000 and sold in November 2025 for USD 1.15m. Net proceeds after mortgage payoff, taxes, and agent fees were approx. USD 760,000. He provided a copy of the signed sale agreement and the HUD-1\/closing statement, which supports most of the figures, though the final bank credit advice is still pending. Additional wealth sources include accumulated rental income from the same property over the years (estimated USD 110,000 net, not fully documented) and savings from his operating business, a small commercial property management LLC, from which he stated he retained approx. USD 47,889 in personal savings. No full financial statements for the LLC were provided at this stage, only last year’s tax return summary.\n\nTotal funds discussed amount to USD 917,889, expected to be consolidated into his account over the next 1–2 months. Documents provided include the property sale contract, partial closing documents, and a personal tax return for 2024. Requested additional documents include full closing statement with proof of funds received, latest mortgage payoff confirmation, and basic financials or bank statements from the LLC to better support the business savings portion.\n\nOverall assessment is that the source of wealth appears reasonable and consistent with the customer’s profile and transaction history. Minor concerns relate to incomplete documentation and reliance on estimates for rental income and business savings, but nothing that appears high risk at this stage. Michael acknowledged the gaps and agreed to provide the remaining documents. No adverse information identified, and transaction rationale aligns with stated real estate investment activity.","structured_output":"{\"customer_name\": \"Michael Turner\", \"occupation\": \"Real estate investor and small business owner (property management LLC)\", \"wealth_sources\": [{\"source_type\": \"property_sale\", \"amount\": 760000, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"description\": \"Net proceeds from the sale of an investment property in Phoenix, AZ purchased in 2016 and sold in November 2025 after mortgage payoff, taxes, and agent fees.\"}, {\"source_type\": \"rental_income\", \"amount\": 110000, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"description\": \"Accumulated net rental income from the Phoenix investment property over several years; amount is estimated and not fully documented.\"}, {\"source_type\": \"business\", \"amount\": 47889, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"description\": \"Personal savings retained from operating a small commercial property management LLC; supported only by a tax return summary.\"}], \"total_amount\": 917889, \"risk_level\": \"low\", \"documents_provided\": [\"Signed property sale agreement\", \"Partial HUD-1\/closing statement\", \"2024 personal tax return\", \"Requested: final closing statement with proof of funds received\", \"Requested: latest mortgage payoff confirmation\", \"Requested: LLC financials or bank statements\"], \"flags\": [\"Incomplete documentation for final sale proceeds\", \"Reliance on estimated rental income figures\", \"Limited documentation for business savings\"]}","scenario_type":"property_sale","difficulty":"medium"}
