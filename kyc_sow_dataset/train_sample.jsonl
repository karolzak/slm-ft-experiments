{"note_text":"Met with Mr. Luca Bianchi on 12 February 2026 to review and document his source of wealth. Mr. Bianchi is an Italian national, resident in Milan, and has been a long-standing client of the bank. He has a background in property investment and has been building and managing a small residential property portfolio over several years.\n\nMr. Bianchi’s occupation is a self-employed property owner and landlord. He owns three residential apartments in Milan which are rented on long-term lease agreements to private tenants. He manages the properties directly and receives rental income on a monthly basis.\n\nThe source of wealth discussed relates to accumulated rental income in the total amount of EUR 21,639. Mr. Bianchi explained that this amount represents net rental income saved over the past 12 months after deduction of property-related expenses and local taxes. The income is generated solely from the rental of his owned properties and has been retained in his personal savings account.\n\nDocumentation provided includes copies of the property ownership deeds, current rental contracts for all three apartments, and bank statements showing regular rental income credits consistent with the stated amounts. An annual tax declaration reflecting declared rental income was also provided. All documents were clear, consistent, and aligned with the explanation given during the meeting.\n\nMy assessment is that the source of wealth is straightforward and well documented. The level of income is reasonable in relation to the size and location of the properties, and the accumulation of EUR 21,639 over the stated period is plausible. No unusual transactions or inconsistencies were identified.\n\nNo concerns or red flags noted.

{"note_text":"Met with customer Daniel Whitmore on 12 Feb 2026 to discuss source of wealth relating to recent and expected inflows totalling approx. GBP 1,291,735. Customer is a UK national, resident in London, mid-40s. He describes himself as a “property investor and consultant” and previously worked in construction project management. Currently self-employed via a personal services company, Whitmore Advisory Ltd, incorporated in the UK.\n\nDaniel advised that the majority of his wealth has been generated through property transactions over the last 8–10 years, combined with retained consulting income and an overseas investment. He presented the following breakdown, though figures changed slightly during the discussion:\n\n1) Sale of UK residential property in Manchester – approx. GBP 865,000 net. Customer stated the property was purchased in 2016 for “around GBP 420k” and sold in October 2025 for GBP 1.02m. He initially stated net proceeds of GBP 890k, later revised this to GBP 865k after “fees and tax”. He has not yet provided a full completion statement. He shared a copy of the Land Registry title and a draft sale memorandum from the estate agent but did not have the solicitor’s completion statement or CGT calculation available. He stated the sale proceeds were first credited to his solicitor’s client account, then partially transferred to an account in his name at a different UK bank before being consolidated.\n\n2) Consulting income retained over time – approx. GBP 210,000. Daniel stated this represents accumulated dividends and director’s loans drawn from Whitmore Advisory Ltd between 2019–2024. He was vague on exact dates and initially said “around GBP 250k”, then said some of that amount was “reinvested and spent”. He provided limited company accounts for FY2022 and FY2023 only, showing net profits broadly consistent with dividend payments, but no personal tax returns or dividend vouchers. He said his accountant holds those and can provide them if needed.\n\n3) Overseas property investment in Spain – approx. GBP 145,000. Customer advised he co-invested in a small residential development in Valencia via a Spanish SL structure in 2018. He claims to have exited in mid-2024 and received EUR 170,000, which he converted to GBP “when rates were good”, estimating GBP 145k. He did not have supporting sale contracts or bank statements to evidence receipt. He mentioned the funds were initially paid to a Spanish bank account, which is now closed. He provided a copy of an old share certificate in the SL and a Spanish notary document, but these do not clearly show exit value. When asked why the account was closed, he said it was “no longer needed” and changed the subject.\n\nTotal wealth cited during the meeting ranged between GBP 1.27m and GBP 1.32m; after discussion we agreed the working figure is approx. GBP 1,291,735, though this remains approximate pending documentation.\n\nJurisdictions involved include the UK and Spain. Customer also briefly mentioned having “looked at opportunities” in Dubai but said no funds were ultimately invested there; this was not elaborated on.\n\nObservations: Daniel was generally cooperative but imprecise with figures and timelines. He appeared confident discussing property but evasive when asked for exact dates, tax treatment, and bank flows, particularly regarding the Spanish investment and CGT on the UK sale. Some inconsistencies noted between verbal figures and documents shown on his phone. He often referred to his accountant or solicitor rather than providing direct answers.\n\nDocuments provided to date: UK passport copy, proof of UK address, Land Registry title for Manchester property, estate agent sale memorandum, limited company accounts (FY2022–2023), Spanish SL share certificate. Documents requested: solicitor’s completion statement for UK property sale, CGT computation, personal tax returns (last 3 years), dividend vouchers or director’s loan statements, bank statements showing receipt of sale proceeds, and evidence of exit and fund flow from Spanish investment.\n\nConcerns\/red flags: incomplete documentation for primary source of funds, inconsistent amounts stated for property sale proceeds, lack of clear audit trail for overseas investment and use of a now-closed foreign bank account, and vague explanations around tax. No immediate adverse information identified, but enhanced due diligence recommended before accepting full inflow.","structured_output":"{\"customer_name\": \"Daniel Whitmore\", \"occupation\": \"Self-employed property investor and consultant operating via Whitmore Advisory Ltd; previously worked in construction project management\", \"wealth_sources\": [{\"source_type\": \"property_sale\", \"amount\": 865000, \"currency\": \"GBP\", \"description\": \"Net proceeds from sale of UK residential property in Manchester purchased in 2016 and sold in October 2025; amount revised during discussion and pending solicitor completion statement and CGT calculation\"}, {\"source_type\": \"investment\", \"amount\": 210000, \"currency\": \"GBP\", \"description\": \"Accumulated consulting income retained over time via dividends and director\\u2019s loans from Whitmore Advisory Ltd between 2019\\u20132024; figures approximate and partially undocumented\"}, {\"source_type\": \"investment\", \"amount\": 145000, \"currency\": \"GBP\", \"description\": \"Proceeds from overseas property development investment in Valencia, Spain via Spanish SL structure; exited mid-2024 with estimated conversion from EUR 170,000; limited supporting documentation and closed foreign bank account\"}], \"total_amount\": 1291735, \"risk_level\": \"medium\", \"documents_provided\": [\"UK passport copy\", \"Proof of UK address\", \"Land Registry title for Manchester property\", \"Estate agent sale memorandum\", \"Limited company accounts FY2022\", \"Limited company accounts FY2023\", \"Spanish SL share certificate\", \"Solicitor\\u2019s completion statement for UK property sale (requested)\", \"CGT computation (requested)\", \"Personal tax returns last 3 years (requested)\", \"Dividend vouchers or director\\u2019s loan statements (requested)\", \"Bank statements showing receipt of sale proceeds (requested)\", \"Evidence of exit and fund flow from Spanish investment (requested)\"], \"flags\": [\"Incomplete documentation for primary source of funds\", \"Inconsistent amounts stated for UK property sale proceeds\", \"Lack of clear audit trail for overseas Spanish investment\", \"Use of a now-closed foreign bank account\", \"Vague explanations regarding tax treatment and timelines\"]}","scenario_type":"property_sale","difficulty":"hard"}

He works as a Senior Software Engineering Manager with a multinational technology firm. He has been employed with the same employer for the past seven years, initially based in Singapore and relocated to the UK in 2022.\n\nThe source of wealth for the USD 197,127 is accumulated employment income and annual performance bonuses earned while working in Singapore and the UK. Mr. Wong explained that he maintained a savings account in Singapore where a portion of his salary and bonuses were deposited between 2018 and 2022. Following his relocation, he consolidated these savings and transferred the funds from his Singapore bank account to his UK account, from which the current transfer to our bank was initiated.

{"note_text":"Met with customer John Martinez today to discuss source of wealth in connection with the recent large credit. John is a 62-year-old US citizen, recently retired. He spent most of his career working as a project manager in the construction and engineering sector, last employed by a mid-sized infrastructure firm in Texas. He retired in late 2024.\n\nTotal funds under review are USD 466,526. Primary source is a pension lump sum payment of approximately USD 382,000 received in November 2025 from his former employer’s defined benefit pension plan. John explained this was paid out upon retirement as a one-time lump sum rather than monthly payments. He provided a copy of the pension payout statement and a partial benefits summary, though the full plan document and final tax statement were not available at the meeting.\n\nSecondary source is a rollover from a 401(k) account held with Fidelity, amounting to around USD 58,500. This was transferred into his personal account earlier this year after he consolidated his retirement accounts. He showed screenshots from the Fidelity app confirming the rollover, but has not yet provided the official rollover confirmation letter.\n\nThe remaining USD 26,026 comes from accumulated personal savings over the years, mainly salary savings and annual bonuses. John stated these funds were held in a checking and savings account with Bank of America prior to transfer. No historical bank statements were provided yet, only the most recent statement showing the outgoing transfer.\n\nDocuments provided so far include: pension lump sum statement, recent bank statement showing receipt of funds, and a copy of his retirement letter from his employer. Documents still requested: full pension plan summary, 401(k) rollover confirmation, and last year’s tax return to confirm retirement income and tax treatment of the lump sum.\n\nMy overall assessment is that the source of wealth is generally consistent with John’s age, career history, and retirement status. Amounts are reasonable for his stated employment background. Minor concern around incomplete documentation, particularly the lack of formal confirmation for the 401(k) rollover and full pension details, but no immediate red flags.

James is a dual UK\/Irish national, currently UK resident for the past 6 years. He works as a senior project manager for a multinational engineering firm and also has some legacy overseas assets.\n\nJames explained that the funds are coming from a combination of three sources across different jurisdictions:\n\n1) Approx. GBP 148,000 from the sale of an apartment in Dublin, Ireland. Property was inherited from his aunt in 2018 and sold in November last year. He provided a copy of the Irish solicitor’s completion statement and the estate distribution letter, but the final bank-to-bank transfer confirmation from the Irish solicitor’s client account is still pending. He expects to receive this shortly.\n\n2) Approx. GBP 55,000 from accumulated employment savings held in a Singaporean bank account. James worked in Singapore between 2014–2019 and retained a local account. He shared historical payslips from his employer at the time and a recent Singapore bank statement, though the statement only shows the closing balance and not the full transaction history. I have requested a longer statement covering at least the last 12 months.\n\n3) Approx. GBP 30,326 from an investment portfolio liquidation in the UK (stocks and ETFs held with an online broker). He provided the broker’s transaction summary and a recent tax statement confirming capital gains declared in the UK.\n\nOverall explanation was coherent and consistent with his background and career history. James was open in the discussion and understood the need for documentation. The cross-border element adds some complexity, and there are minor gaps around the full audit trail for the Irish property proceeds and the Singapore account history, but nothing appears inconsistent at this stage.\n\nNo immediate red flags identified. Main follow-up is to obtain the missing transfer confirmation from the Irish solicitor and extended bank statements from Singapore to complete the source of wealth file.

{"note_text":"Met with customer John Ramirez today to discuss source of wealth for recent and anticipated account activity. John is a 42-year-old US citizen, currently residing locally, and has been a client of the bank since 2019. Background is fairly straightforward. He works as a senior product manager at a mid-sized technology company and has been in the tech sector for over 15 years. Annual salary approx. USD 145k plus variable bonus.\n\nJohn explained that the primary source of wealth under review relates to investment returns totaling approximately USD 433,281 accumulated over the last 6–7 years. Breakdown as follows: approx. USD 245,000 from long-term equity investments (mainly US-listed stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, and several ETFs held via a brokerage account with Vanguard), approx. USD 128,000 from mutual funds and index funds (mix of S&P 500 and total market funds), and approx. USD 60,000 from bond funds and fixed income ETFs. He stated that most investments were funded through regular monthly contributions from salary and annual bonuses.\n\nDocuments provided during or after the meeting include recent brokerage statements covering the last 12 months and a summary portfolio report from Vanguard. These generally support the current balance and recent performance, but do not fully show the original cost basis or the full history of contributions. John indicated he may be able to request older statements if needed, though it may take some time as some investments date back to 2016–2017. We also requested last two years of tax returns to confirm declared investment income and capital gains; these have not yet been received.\n\nMy overall observation is that John was open, cooperative, and knowledgeable about his investments. The story is consistent with his professional profile and income level. Portfolio performance seems reasonable given market conditions, and there were no signs of unusual trading activity or third-party involvement. Minor concern is the lack of complete historical documentation showing how the full USD 433k accumulated over time, particularly earlier years. However, this appears to be a documentation gap rather than a substantive issue. No immediate red flags identified at this stage.

He is in his mid-40s and has been a long‑standing client of the bank since 2016. He has an entrepreneurial background and was the sole shareholder and managing director of a small logistics software company.\n\nOccupation \/ business details: Mr. Meyer founded and operated LM Solutions SARL, a B2B software company providing route optimization tools for regional transport firms. The business was established in 2011 and employed approx. 12 staff at its peak. He confirmed that he sold 100% of his shares in the company in mid‑2025 to a larger German tech group.\n\nSource(s) of wealth:\n1) Sale of business – approx. EUR 620,000 net proceeds. Mr. Meyer explained that the gross sale price was around EUR 700,000, with deductions for taxes, legal fees, and advisory costs. The EUR 620,000 represents net proceeds received in two tranches, with the final payment credited last month.\n2) Accumulated personal savings – approx. EUR 35,000. Savings built up over several years from salary and dividends paid by LM Solutions prior to the sale.\n3) Minor investment income – approx. EUR 10,255 from a French investment fund portfolio held with another bank, recently transferred to consolidate funds.\n\nDocuments provided \/ requested: Mr. Meyer provided a signed share purchase agreement (SPA) summary and a bank statement showing receipt of the final sale proceeds. He also shared historic company financial statements for 2022–2024.

{"note_text":"Met with customer: Daniel Harper, age 41. Daniel is a US citizen currently residing locally for work. He comes across as open and cooperative, answered questions without hesitation. Background is fairly straightforward, no prior relationship with the bank.\n\nOccupation: Daniel works as a senior project manager for a mid-sized construction consultancy (Harper & Cole Consulting LLC). Employed there since 2016. Annual salary approx. USD 115k–125k based on his explanation, plus occasional performance bonuses. He is not an owner in the business and does not receive dividends.\n\nSource of wealth discussed in today’s meeting:\n\nPrimary source is inherited wealth from his late aunt, Margaret Lewis, who passed away in November 2024. Daniel explained he was one of two beneficiaries of her estate. His portion of the estate transfer totaled USD 572,528, which was distributed to him in two tranches from the estate’s attorney-managed escrow account. Funds were received in December 2024 and January 2025 and are now sitting in his personal checking account pending longer-term planning.\n\nSecondary sources include accumulated employment savings of approximately USD 180,000 built up over the last 10+ years from salary, plus around USD 45,000 in a brokerage account invested in mutual funds and ETFs. These are not being transferred at this stage but were discussed to understand overall profile.\n\nDocuments provided: Daniel shared a copy of the estate distribution letter from the law firm handling the probate, showing his name and the total inheritance amount. He also provided recent bank statements reflecting the incoming transfers. Copy of death certificate was not available at the meeting; he said he can request one from the attorney if required. No full probate court documents provided yet.\n\nDocuments requested: Asked Daniel to provide a copy of the will or probate summary confirming beneficiary status, and either the death certificate or a formal confirmation letter from the estate attorney. Also requested last two years of tax returns to confirm reporting of inheritance and employment income.\n\nObservations and assessment: Inheritance story is consistent and aligns with the transaction history shown. Amount and timing make sense given probate timelines. Daniel appears financially literate but not sophisticated; main goal is capital preservation with some moderate growth. He mentioned plans to use part of the funds for a home purchase in the next 12–18 months.\n\nConcerns \/ red flags: Minor documentation gaps at this stage, mainly around probate confirmation, but nothing that raises significant concern. Estate was domestic (US-based), no offshore structures or complex vehicles involved. Will follow up once remaining documents are received, but overall source of wealth appears legitimate and manageable from a KYC perspective.","structured_output":"{\"customer_name\": \"Daniel Harper\", \"occupation\": \"Senior project manager at Harper & Cole Consulting LLC (construction consultancy)\", \"wealth_sources\": [{\"source_type\": \"inheritance\", \"amount\": 572528, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"description\": \"Inherited funds received from late aunt Margaret Lewis, distributed from attorney-managed estate escrow in December 2024 and January 2025.\"}, {\"source_type\": \"employment\", \"amount\": 180000, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"description\": \"Accumulated employment savings built up over more than 10 years from salary as a senior project manager.\"}, {\"source_type\": \"investment\", \"amount\": 45000, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"description\": \"Brokerage account holdings invested in mutual funds and ETFs.\"}], \"total_amount\": 797528, \"risk_level\": \"low\", \"documents_provided\": [\"Estate distribution letter from probate law firm\", \"Recent bank statements showing inheritance transfers\", \"Copy of will or probate summary (requested)\", \"Death certificate or formal confirmation letter from estate attorney (requested)\", \"Last two years of tax returns (requested)\"], \"flags\": [\"Minor documentation gaps related to probate confirmation\"]}","scenario_type":"inheritance","difficulty":"medium"}
